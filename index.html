            <p>
              <a href="https://pixelnfts.github.io/">Pixels NFT</a> is a
              premium in-game currency in Pixels. Unlike $BERRY, which operates
              on an inflationary model and can be easily acquired through
              in-game interactions to facilitate gameplay, $PIXEL will be
              difficult to come by & provide different utility. Expect utility
              that will enhance gameplay but will not hinder free-to-play
              players from participating.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recently, players and speculators are starting to get their eyes
              on Pixels, which is a new MMO game with an integrated play-to-earn
              ecosystem. MMO games surely hit our gamer vibes and excite us to
              meet and interact with the other members of the community. Let‚Äôs
              dive deep on how to start playing Pixels!
            </p>

            <p>Utility you can expect:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>‚û°Ô∏è Guild features</li>
              <li>‚û°Ô∏è Pet Mints</li>
              <li>‚û°Ô∏è Quality of Life enhancements</li>
            </ul>

            <strong> How will it be generated: </strong>

            <p>
              Players will be able to earn PIXELS NFT by playing Pixels, but not
              as easily as they can $BERRY. PIXELS NFT generation is loosely
              integrated to the core gameloop of Pixels, unlike $BERRY. Only top
              players will be able to earn PIXEL NFT by completing challenging
              tasks or actively contributing to the ecosystem‚Äôs growth.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Pixels Nft?</h2>
            <p>
              Just like the other play-to-earn games, Pixels is trying to build
              an ecosystem wherein players use digital assets as avatars in the
              game to progress further and gather rewards that they will truly
              own too. In terms of long-term vision, the team behind Pixels is
              trying to create a game similar to the popular game called
              Runescape in the traditional gaming genre.
            </p>

            <p>
              During this early stage of development, however, the game will
              begin as an MMO game with a farming mechanic. Farming is the first
              mechanic released in the game. The set of farming mechanics takes
              heavy inspiration from the popular traditional games Animal
              Crossing and Stardew Valley. Furthermore, players can try out
              Pixels for free as the game currently features a free-to-play
              ‚Äòplay as a guest‚Äô feature when you load up the game so everyone
              can try out!
            </p>

            <p>
              Based on this official tweet from the team, the game also received
              massive fundraising investments that were as big as $2.4 million
              funds led by Animoca Brands and PKO investments with OpenSea,
              Untapped Capital, and Leonis Capital joining the seed round as
              well.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to this recent tweet from the official Pixels team, the
              game released better gameplay and more content. Additionally,
              players received rewards for playing the game and gathering
              play-to-airdrop points as they progressed to get rewards.
            </p>

            <strong>Players in the game were able to gather play-to-airdrop points by the following methods:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Playing and progressing through the game</li>
                <li>Becoming a top player in the leaderboards</li>
                <li>Completing quests</li>
                <li>Owning a land</li>
                <li>Holding land</li>
                <li>Sharing the game!</li>
            </u>

            <p>Also, the tweet announced that over the last two months, Pixels gained a massive popularity in the space gathering the following milestones: </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Over 500,000 people playing Pixels</li>
            <li>Peaked at 40,000 DAU</li>
            <li>80,000 active wallets on-chain</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>How it all started: Play-to-Airdrop</h2>
            <p>
              One year ago, we ran an experiment and coined it ‚ÄòPlay-to-Airdrop‚Äô (P2A). This was a brand-new concept. It allowed anyone with a wallet & an internet connection to participate. Users didn‚Äôt have to join alpha groups or get whitelist codes from influencers; they just had to play the game. Since then, the concept of P2A has taken over Web3. P2A campaigns have become the new standard.
            </p>

            <h3>How to participate: P2A 2.0 starts now!
            </h3>

            <p>
              This P2A is totally different. Say goodbye to the days of tirelessly harvesting carrots until your hand ached!
            </p>

            <p>
              There are still badges to earn, but they‚Äôre a bit different. And I heard there might be some new quests coming out as well!
            </p>
